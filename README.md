# Simple IRC Chat in Python
##### Basic implementation of an IRC-conforming chat, demonstrated
##### by running Server and Client files in a local development environment.  
&nbsp;
This is a project for an Internetworking Protocols course I took at Portland State University.

## Local Demo
> Install any necessary modules (currently none)
> ```
> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> Open at least two terminals and/or command prompts,
> Use one to run the server:
> ```
> python3 IRC-Server.py
> ```
> And others to run the client(s):
> ```
> python3 IRC-Client.py


## Future Goals
- Refactor
- Add persistence
- Allow server configuration
- Containerize
